     1. Create the h2 tag "Favorite Foods." -->
    <h2>"Favorite Foods"</h2>
      <!--  2. Create an unordered list of at least three of your favorite foods.   -->
    <ul>
    <li>sushi</li>
    <li>steak</li>
    <li>pasta</li>
  </ul>
      <!--  3. Make an h2 header for "Favorite Animals."    -->
    <h2>Favorite Animals</h2>
      <!--  4. Make an ordered list of at least three of your favorite animals. -->
    <ol>
      <li>Sloth</li>

    </ol>
      <!--  5. Make an h3 header for "Cute Animals."    -->
    <h3>"Cute Animals"</h3>
      <!--  6. Are you a cat or a dog person? Why not both? Make a paragraph tag containing the text, "It's raining cats and dogs!" -->
    <p>"It's raining cats and dogs!"</p>
      <!--  7. Make an image tag with the alt attribute set to "Dog Picture" and the src attribute set to "http://place-puppy.com/200x200"  -->
    <img alt="Dog Picture" src="http://place-puppy.com/200x200">
      <!--  8. Make an image tag with the alt attribute set to "Cat Picture" and the src attribute set to "http://placekitten.com/200/200"  -->
    <img alt="Cat Picture" src="http://placekitten.com/200/200"
      <!--  9. Don't forget to give credit! Let's make a link tag (<a>) that credits placekitten. The href attribute should be set to the website address "http://placekitten.com" and the link text (between the opening and closing tags) should be "Place Kitten."   -->
    <a></a>
    <br/>
<h2>"Links for pets"
  <a></a>
  <br/>
    <a href="http://placekitten.com"> "Place kitten" </a>
     <!--  10. Repeat step 9 for place-puppy.   -->
    <a></a>
    <br/>
    
    <a href="http://place-puppy.com/200x200"> "Place puppy"</a>
     <!--  11. Wrap your two links from steps 9 and 10 in a paragraph (<p>) tag to place them on their own line.    -->
</h2>  <!-- BONUS:
      - The numbers on the placeholder links represent the image size in pixels. Try changing the numbers to see different images of cats and dogs in various sizes.
      - Explore a little! There are tons of image placeholder sites-not just for cats and dogs, but for many different interests. Find one that you really like and put an example in.
